Good Morning Sir
I am Dara Obademi, I got your number from Sir Kombo
I recently got admission for a masters program in Electrical Engineering for fall of 2024 at PVAMU,
I was introduced to sir Kombo by one of my elder brother.
The main reason for reaching out is to be able to get a Research Assistant role before resumption in Fall,
I discussed with Sir Kombo on some of the steps I have taken to get a placement which includes reaching out to 3 profs at
two centers that are affliated with Electrical Engineering department,
I sent mails to Prof Lijun Quian and Prof Suxia Cui of CREDIT and also to Prof Shuza Binzaid of SMART,
but none of them responded yet.
Sir Kombo told me yesterday that you advised that I seek Research Assistantship in another department aside Electrical Engineering.
I am new to PVAMU and how research assistantship work, I would appreciate if you could advise me on where and how to seek Research Assitantship in else where.
I will also appreciate your guidance sir, on how things work in the department.
The Research assistantship will help me a great deal in the aspect of funding my Masters Program, and your advice on electrical department will help
me navigate the department during the course of my program, as I look forward to resuming this fall
Thanks a lot for your time Sir, I do really appreciate.
