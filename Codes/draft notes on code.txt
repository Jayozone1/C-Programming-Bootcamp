//Write a program that receives a coordinate point in XY system.
//The program should print in which quadrant the point is at.

Write a Program that receives an integer representing seconds.
The Program should convert the given seconds into 
1. Total Hours
2. Total Minutes
3. Remaining Seconds.
 And print the result in the following format


e.g "seconds"   4000
    Hours: 1 Hours (3600 seconds)
    Minutes: 4000 - 3600 =  400/60 = 6 mins
    Seconds : 400 % 60 = 40 Sec


Psuedocode

variables num, hours, minutes, seconds

prompt for system to receive integer

for hours, num - 3600

for minutes = (num - 3600)/ 60

for seconds =  || ((num - 3600)/ 60) % 60.

Write a Program that receives 3 integers.
The program should print "Divisible" if in each pair
between the three numbers there is at least one number that can be divided by the other -without a remainder.

Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year.
 
Leap year has 366days.

conditions
1. if the year can be divided by 4 without remainder.
2. If the year can also be divided by 100(without a remainder) - then ir's not a leap year.
3. Unless the year can be divided by 400 - then it's a leap year

Write a program that receives a day, month and a year.
The program should find and print the next day on the calender.

Average Grade Calculator.

Develop a unique Average grade Calculator.
- The calculator should recieve grades from the user- until a "stopping condition" is met.
- The program should calculate the average grade and print it.


Grade Calculator.

Steps to adding grades.

1. Take in grades
2. Add the grades.
3. Divide the total number of grades by the number of grades.


Steps to the program.
1. Take any number of grades.
- A propmt to ask the user what is the number of grades.
2. A statement to display and store the number of grades.

3. Continne adding the grades till zero.
4. Dividing the sum of grades by the number.

int num_grades;
float grade;

printf("Enter the number of grades: ");
scanf("%d", &num_grades);

for (i int i = 1; i <= num_grades; i++) {
	printf("Enter grade %d: ", i);
	scanf("%f", &grade);
	totalMarks += grade;
     }

float averageGrade = totalMarks / num_grades;

printf("Average grade: %.2f\n", averageGrade);

return 0;

}

Do - While Loop
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int price, totalPrice = 0;

	do{
	  printf("Please enter a price: ");
	  scanf("%d", &price);
	  totalPrice = totalPrice + price;
	}while (price != 0);

	printf("Total Order Price = %d \n", totalPrice);
	return 0;
}
While Loop
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int price, totalPrice = 0;

	printf("Please enter a price: ");
	scanf("%d", &price);

	while(price != 0)
	{
		totalPrice = totalPrice + price;
		printf("Please enter a price: ");
		scanf("%d", &price);
	}

	printf("Total Order Price = %d \n", totalPrice);
	return 0;
}


for (i = 1; i <= num; i++)


int num;
int powr;
int temppow;

int result = 1;

printf("Enter the number: ");
scanf("%d", &num);

printf("Enter the power: ");
scanf("%d", &powr);

for (i = 1; i <= powr; i++)
{
	result = result * num
}

printf("%d in the power of %d = %d\n", num, powr, result);

return 0;

For Loops.
Write a program that receives an integer -"n". The Program should print a right-angled triangle with the following pattern to a given "n".
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdio.h> 
  
int main() 
{ 
    int end = 5; 
  
    printf("Pattern Printing using Nested While loop"); 
  
    int i = 1; 
  
    while (i <= end) { 
        printf("\n"); 
        int j = 1; 
        while (j <= i) { 
            printf("%d ", j); 
            j = j + 1; 
        } 
        i = i + 1; 
    } 
    return 0; 
}


int i;
int n;
